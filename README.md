# Echogarden package repository (no longer used)

This is an out-of-date package repository that was used by earlier versions of Echogarden. On newer versions, it has been replaced by a [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/echogarden/echogarden-packages) instead.

Hugging Face provides better support for large files and potentially higher download speeds due to its use of a global CDN.
